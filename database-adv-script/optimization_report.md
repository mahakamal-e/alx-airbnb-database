## Optimization Report
### Overview
This report covers the optimization of a complex query that retrieves all bookings along with user details, property details, and payment details. The goal was to analyze the initial queryâ€™s performance and improve it.

### Initial Query
The initial query performs multiple JOINs between Booking, User, Property, and Payment tables to get full booking information.

Query:
```sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    Booking.booking_id,
    Booking.start_date,
    Booking.end_date,
    Booking.total_price,
    Booking.status,
    User.first_name,
    User.last_name,
    User.email,
    Property.name AS property_name,
    Property.location,
    Property.price_per_night,
    Payment.amount AS payment_amount,
    Payment.payment_method
FROM Booking
JOIN User ON Booking.user_id = User.user_id
JOIN Property ON Booking.property_id = Property.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment ON Booking.booking_id = Payment.booking_id;
```
### Performance Analysis
Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE showed that the initial query scanned large amounts of data across all tables, leading to slower performance especially with big datasets. No filtering was applied, causing full table scans.

Optimization Actions
Added a filtering condition on Booking status to reduce result size: WHERE Booking.status = 'confirmed'.

Ensured indexes exist on key columns such as Booking.user_id, Booking.property_id, and Booking.status for faster lookups.

Optimized Query
```sql

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    Booking.booking_id,
    Booking.start_date,
    Booking.end_date,
    Booking.total_price,
    Booking.status,
    User.first_name,
    User.last_name,
    User.email,
    Property.name AS property_name,
    Property.location,
    Property.price_per_night,
    Payment.amount AS payment_amount,
    Payment.payment_method
FROM Booking
JOIN User ON Booking.user_id = User.user_id
JOIN Property ON Booking.property_id = Property.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment ON Booking.booking_id = Payment.booking_id
WHERE Booking.status = 'confirmed';
```
### Results
After applying filtering and ensuring proper indexing, the query execution time improved noticeably. The reduced dataset size and use of indexes allowed the database engine to avoid full scans, which enhances scalability.
